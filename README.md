# WebexTeamsMeetsIOT
Webex Teams bot integration with a smart switch (communicating through MQTT)
By Sari (sarifern@cisco.com) and Luis(luribegu@cisco.com)

This project integrates a simple chat bot (written in Python, using Flask), MQTT (server hosted in Heroku) and a Smart Switch Sonoff Basic, flashed using Sonoff Tasmota project (https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota)

The Webex teams bot was taken and customized from the DevNet Webexteamssdk Repo (webexteamssdk/examples/bot-example-flask.py)
All implementation details will be uploaded soon.
